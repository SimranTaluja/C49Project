        <ul><p><i>Interesting Facts About Cicada</i></p>

        <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
        <li>Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.</li></ul>

        <ul><p><i>Interesting Facts About Pigeon</i></p>
        <li>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</li>
        <li>Although pigeon droppings are seen by some as a problem in modern society, a few centuries ago pigeon guano was seen as extremely valuable. It was viewed as the best available fertiliser and armed guards would even stand by dovecotes (pigeon houses) to stop others taking the droppings.</li>
        <li>Despite the social perception as dirty and disease-ridden, pigeons are actually very clean animals and there is very little evidence to suggest that they are significant transmitters of disease.</li></ul>

        <ul><p><i>Interesting Facts About Teddy Bear</i></p></ul>
        <li>In Southey’s original story, the visitor to the bears’ house was an ugly old woman. Goldilocks only entered the tale in later versions.</li>
        <li>The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.</li>
        <li>Bear hugs predate teddy bears by 60 years. The term bear-hug was first recorded in 1846.</li>
